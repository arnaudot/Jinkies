# arnaudot/Jinkies/AutoHotKey
### This is my AHK scripts that I use, which aren't a lot compared to what I could use, but whatever.
## IMPORTANT! Not everything is perfect! I'm trying to fix bugs which in scripts like gravetabs.ahk, are common. It might be perfect for you, but not to my standards.
### More info about them are inside the script in the comments (The parts that begin with ";")
* easywindowdragger.ahk -
This is a KDE style window mover made by ck, thinkstorm, Chris and aurelian on the AutoHotkey forum. I've modified it so you can choose what modifier key to use (The default is Alt, which interferes with programs like Adobe Premiere Pro.
* gravetabs.ahk -
I made this because I was bored, but it's actually useful for people who keep like 70 tabs open. I have two of them for spanish (ยบ) and english (`) layouts, mainly because it's my laptop's layout.
* volumewheel.ahk -
This is to end for good the inconsistency between laptop keyboards, and so you don't need to tab out on PC if you wanna change the volume or skip a song while in a game.
